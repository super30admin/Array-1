# APPROACH 1: BRUTE FORCE
# Time Complexity : O(n^2), n: length of nums
# Space Complexity : O(1), not considering the space for output array
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : NO (Time limit exceeded)
# Any problem you faced while coding this : None (Initially, just compared the numbers, but doesn't work for the duplicates)
#
#
# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# 1. For each element, go through the whole array
# 2. Take product of all those elements whose position is not same as the element
# 3. Save the product in the output array

# APPROACH 2: Intermediate (Before class)  
# Time Complexity : O(n), n: length of nums
# Space Complexity : O(n), due to left_arr and right_arr
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : None
#
#
# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# 1. In left_arr, store the product of all elements before it (go from left to right) in one pass
# 2. In right_arr, store the product of all elements before it (go from right to left) in one pass 
# 3. In result, take the product of both left_arr and right_arr index-wise

 # APPROACH 3: OPTIMAL SOLUTION (Before class) -SAME APPROACH AS ABOVE BUT SAVING THE SPACE
# Time Complexity : O(n), n: lengh of nums
# Space Complexity : O(1), not considering the space of the ouput array
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : None
#
#
# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach 
# 1. In result, store the product of all elements before it (go from left to right) in one pass
# 2. In result, store the product of all elements before it (go from right to left) in one pass - start from the other end, multiply each element of the result with the previous
#     element.
# 3. Tke care of the first and last element (don't have left and right neighbors respectively).
