Im using a hashmap to store the values in an array
The values are grouped by the sum of the (i,j) as key


then iterating throught the hashmap and appending it to the res array 
 The direction is changed based on odd even

Two Flgas are maintained for the direction 1 and -1

and based on the direction the row and column is incremented
