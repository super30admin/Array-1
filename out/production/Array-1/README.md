# Array-1

## Problem 1

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

## Problem 2

Given a matrix of M x N elements (M rows, N columns), return all elements of the matrix in diagonal order as shown in the below image.

Example:

Input:

[

[ 1, 2, 3 ],

[ 4, 5, 6 ],

[ 7, 8, 9 ]

]

Output: [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

## Problem 3
Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:

Input:

[

[ 1, 2, 3 ],

[ 4, 5, 6 ],

[ 7, 8, 9 ]

]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
Example 2:

Input:

[

[1, 2, 3, 4],

[5, 6, 7, 8],

[9,10,11,12]

]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
